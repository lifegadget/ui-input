  # ui-input
  > HTML input controls for ambitious Ember apps

  ## Installation
  Go to the terminal and type:

  ```sh
  ember install ui-input
  ```

  If you are using SASS (recommended), then add the following your your `app.scss`:

  ```sass
  @import 'ui-input';
  ```

  This import statement will bring in the input-specific CSS from Bootstrap 4 but nothing more. If you actually
  do want to add more from Bootstrap you can may also choose from these presets:

  ```sass
  @import 'ui-grid'; // imports just the Bootstrap grid
  @import 'ui-bootstrap'; // imports everything (with flexbox turned on)
  ```
